Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting credit card fraud using machine learning techniques to mitigate financial losses by identifying fraudulent transactions.

Problem Statement
Fraudulent transactions are rare and hard to detect, posing a significant challenge to financial institutions. The goal is to identify these fraudulent transactions without disrupting legitimate activities.

Project Objective
To build a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting fraudulent credit card transactions, minimizing false positives while maximizing fraud detection.

Column Dictionary
Column Name	Description
distance_from_home	Distance from the cardholder's home to the transaction location
distance_from_last_transaction	Distance from the previous transaction
ratio_to_median_purchase_price	Ratio of transaction value to the median purchase price
repeat_retailer	Whether the transaction was from a repeat retailer (1: Yes, 0: No)
used_chip	Whether a chip was used in the transaction (1: Yes, 0: No)
used_pin_number	Whether a PIN number was used (1: Yes, 0: No)
online_order	Whether the transaction was online (1: Yes, 0: No)
fraud	Indicates if the transaction was fraudulent (1: Fraud, 0: Legitimate)
Data Preprocessing
Missing Data
We checked for missing values using df.isnull().sum(). Missing data was imputed or removed based on its significance.

Outlier Detection and Handling
Outliers were detected using box plots for key columns:

distance_from_home
distance_from_last_transaction
ratio_to_median_purchase_price
To handle outliers, we capped values using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method via a custom cap_outliers function. This ensured that extreme values did not skew the model.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Correlation Heatmap: Plotted to examine relationships between features.
Class Distribution: Checked the balance of fraudulent vs. legitimate transactions in the fraud column.
Feature Engineering
Distance Ratio: Calculated the ratio of distance_from_home to distance_from_last_transaction.
Transaction Score: Combined multiple features to create a transaction risk score.
Purchase Category: Grouped transactions based on ratio_to_median_purchase_price into categories:
very_low, low, medium, high, very_high
Encoding: Encoded purchase categories using a custom function to make them model-ready.
Feature Selection, Train-Test Split & Scaling
Selected significant features based on correlation analysis.
Split the dataset into training and test sets using an 80-20 ratio.
Applied Standard Scaler for feature normalization.

Conclusion
Our credit card fraud detection model demonstrated a significant ability to distinguish between fraudulent and legitimate transactions. By leveraging machine learning techniques such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest, we developed a robust solution capable of identifying fraudulent transactions with high accuracy.

Key Insights:
Fraud Detection Efficiency: The model consistently identified fraudulent transactions with minimal false positives, reducing potential financial losses for credit card companies and enhancing customer trust.
Impact on Fraud Prevention: By accurately detecting fraudulent transactions, financial institutions can minimize disruptions to legitimate transactions, improving the overall user experience.
High-Risk Factors: Features like unusually high transaction distances and online orders showed strong correlations with fraud, offering valuable indicators for real-time monitoring systems.
Recommendations:
Real-Time Monitoring: Implementing this model in a real-time transaction monitoring system can help flag high-risk transactions promptly, reducing fraud-related losses.
Continuous Model Updating: Regular updates with new transaction data will ensure the model adapts to emerging fraud patterns.
Customer Awareness: Educating customers about common fraud triggers, such as unusual transaction patterns and PIN security, can further strengthen fraud prevention.
Integration with Multi-Layer Security: This model should complement other security measures, such as two-factor authentication, to enhance fraud detection and prevention.
By integrating this machine learning-based solution into financial systems, organizations can strengthen their defenses against fraud, ensuring both security and a seamless customer experience.
